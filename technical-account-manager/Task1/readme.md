# Task 1: Fix broken Sovendus Integration

## Objective

A partner reports that they finished the integration according to our documentation (see below), but the Sovendus Voucher Network Banner is not showing.

Your goal is to figure out what the issue(s) are and provide a proper solution to the partner.

Imagine you are currently on a call with the partner and Marcus plays the role as the developer of the partner.

In the real world, you would do a test on the partner's website and debug it there. But in our case, you have the [`broken sovendus integration example`](https://ivory-charyl-36.tiiny.site/).

A copy of the source code can be found here:
[`broken-sovendus.html`](broken-sovendus.html)

Imagine you just did a test purchase **using a Sovendus voucher code "test-123"**, and then you landed on `broken-sovendus.html`.
According to our system the partner uses traffic source number: 4704 and medium number: 2
