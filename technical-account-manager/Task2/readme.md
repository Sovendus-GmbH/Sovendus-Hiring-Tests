# Task 2: Browser Developer Tools

## Objective

A partner reports that they finished the integration according to our documentation (from Task 0), but the Sovendus Voucher Network Banner is not showing.

Your goal is to figure out what the issue(s) are and provide a proper solution to the partner. You have to craft an email explaining what and how they have to fix it. The receiver is a developer in this case.

In the real world, you would do a test on the partner's website and debug it there. But in our case, you have the `broken-sovendus.html`. Imagine you just did a test purchase **using a Sovendus voucher code**, and then you landed on `broken-sovendus.html`.
